        <p><strong>Flowers are the most beautiful flower God has created. They are of different shapes, colours, and
                different
                sizes. My favourite flowers are Rose and are known as the flower of love. The rose is found all over the
                world.<br>
                The rose is a type of flowering shrub known for its beauty and fragrance. It is native to Asia and
                Europe,
                but
                has been cultivated and hybridized in many different regions of the world. There are more than 100
                species
                of
                roses, and they come in a wide range of colors, including red, pink, yellow, white, and orange.<br>

                Roses are also used in herbal medicine. Rose hips, the fruit of the rose plant, are high in vitamins C
                and E
                and
                are used to make tea and other health remedies. Rose petals and essential oil are also used in some
                herbal
                remedies. Due to its aesthetic beauty and qualities rose is coined with the name of Queen of the
                flowers.

                In addition to their aesthetic and kkkaromatic qualities, roses also have a long history of symbolic
                meaning.
                In
                many cultures, the rose is seen as a symbol of love and romance and is often associated with Valentine's
                Day
                and
                other romantic occasions. In Christianity, the rose is associated with the Virgin Mary and is often used
                as
                a
                symbol of beauty.

        <h2>THE STAGE OF FLOWER LIFE STYLE</h2>
        <article>
            <P><i>The plant<ins>life cycle </ins>starts when a seed falls on the ground. There are many different kinds
                    of plant life,
                    but the flowering plants, or angiosperms, are the most advanced and widespread due to their amazing
                    ability to attract pollinators and spread seeds.<b> Flowers </b>are more than beautiful objects to
                    look at or
                    decorate with; they serve a very important purpose in the reproduction of plants. The major stages
                    of
                    the flower life cycle are the seed, germination, growth, reproduction, pollination, and seed
                    spreading
                    stages.</i></P>
        </article>


        <h2>SEED STAGE</h2>
        <p>The plant life cycle starts with a seed; every seed holds a miniature plant called the embryo. There are two
            types of flowering plant seeds: dicots and monocots. An example of a dicot is a bean seed. It has two parts
            called cotyledons in addition to the embryo. The cotyledons store food for the plant. Cotyledons are also
            the first leaves that a plant has-they emerge from the ground during germination. Monocots have only one
            cotyledon-the corn seed is an example. Both kinds of seeds have the beginnings of a root system as well. The
            hard outside of the seed is called the seed coat and it protects the embryo. Some seeds are capable of
            growing even after many years if they are kept cool and dry.</p>

        <h2>GERMINATION</h2>
        <P> a seed falls on the ground, it needs warmth and water in order to germinate; some seeds also need light.
            Dicots have seed coats that soften with moisture. After being planted in the soil for a few days, the seed
            absorbs water and swells until the seed coat splits. Monocots have harder seed coats that do not split, but
            stay in one piece. The stem, called the hypocotyl, pushes through the soil along with the cotyledons, or
            seed leaves; this is called germination, or sprouting. The tiny root pushes down and grows, looking for
            water and nutrients. Soon the cotyledons fall off and the first true leaves emerge. It is important that the
            seed is planted in the right place at the right time in order for it to germinate. Some seeds need to go
            through a fire in order to sprout, such as prairie grasses. Some need to go through the stomachs of animals,
            or be scraped. Different seeds have different needs!></P>
        <h2>GROWTH</h2>
        <P><span>In order to complete the flower life cycle stage of growth, plants have to produce their own food. This
                process is called photosynthesis. As soon as the leaves emerge, they start the process of
                photosynthesis.
                Plants contain chloroplasts in the leaves which convert the energy from sunlight, carbon dioxide, and
                water
                into sugars, which they use as food. The plants store the sugars in the roots and stem. The root system
                continues to develop, anchoring the plant into the ground and growing root hairs which help the plant to
                better absorb water and nutrients. The stem grows longer towards the sun and transports water and food
                between the roots and leaves. Sugars and starches are changed into energy used to make new plant growth.
                New
                leaves grow from the top of the stem, or meristem. After a while, flower buds develop. Some plants
                flower
                within days while it takes others months or even years.</span></P>
